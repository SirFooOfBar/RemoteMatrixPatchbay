# Explanation
I recently switched to pipewire and wanted a better way to manage connections between inputs and outputs. I love qjackctl, but honestly connect enough inputs and outputs and it becomes a confusing mess. I wanted it to be immeadiately obvious what was connected to what. So I hashed this out in a couple of hours. I'm putting it here for anyone interested. As to why It's a client server type deal written in javascript, I wanted to be able to control it with my phone. That's probably oddly specific, but that's what I wanted to do so.

# Running
Install python3, python-aiohttp and python-jack from your package manager of choice. Then run ./main.py, connect to localhost:8080 and it's off to the races. Alternatively you can install jack and aiohttp from pip with pip install -r requirements.txt
